I decided to move to Munich in March 2023. 
Both of my children live in this city and I will move close to them. 

As a retired professor, I will start a new business on my own, focusing on three activities
- I will provide consulting services to companies and organizations to help strategic decision makers develop critical thinking skills to make decisions in times of uncertainty.
- I will be teaching English and Spanish to high school and middle school students to develop their critical thinking skills.
